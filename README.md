# JavaScript: Handling Falsy Values

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error involving the handling of falsy values and provides a solution.

## Bug Description

The `foo` function correctly handles `null` inputs, returning `null` when either `a` or `b` is `null`. However, it doesn't account for other falsy values such as `0`, `false`, `''`, `undefined`, etc., which can lead to unexpected behavior. 

## Solution

The solution introduces stricter null checks or comprehensive type validation to address this limitation, ensuring the function behaves as expected in all scenarios, even with falsy values that are not null.
